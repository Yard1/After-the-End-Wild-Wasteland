uahomche_DESC;Nahualist blends aspects of both Christianity and the traditional Mayan faith. Adherents believe that the Event was the end of the 5th world cycle, which was caused by both a lack of sacrifices and the conversion of Mayan believers to monotheism. Gods in the Nahualist pantheon are referred to as ‘angels’, but most of these ‘angels’ are simply pre-Christian Maya deities under a different name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
