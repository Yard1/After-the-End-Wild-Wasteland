EVTDESCAFI106;I can almost feel the weight of the office over my head already, but it is far from burdensome: I feel reinvigorated by the prospect of finally becoming [Root.GetTitle]. Thinking about my new responsibilities as an anointed ruler fills me with trepidation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBAFI112;With the ceremony finally concluded, [From.GetTitledFirstName] bid me farewell and dismissed me from [From.GetHerHis] encampment, alongside all [From.GetHerHis] other guests. I still cannot believe that the inauguration was not abruptly interrupted by an enemy raid... [From.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must really be protecting [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI113;I cannot believe my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has still not managed to be officially inaugurated [From.GetTitle]. Not only is [From.GetHerHis] display of weakness a threat to realm peace: tales of [From.GetHerHis] incompetence will surely drag my name in the mud alongside [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI114;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] stormed my private study this evening, berating me for not having managed to legitimize my rule over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with a proper Inauguration Ceremony yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI115;The nerve of [From.GetFirstName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] dared to deflect my just criticisms of [From.GetHerHis] misconduct by pointing out that I have also yet to prove my legitimacy as [Root.GetTitle] before the Founders. Sometimes I truly cannot stand [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI116;My liege's rule has yet to be properly legitimized by the holy right of inauguration. I must inform [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] current condition is becoming a hindrance to my work as Secretary of State of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI117;Some time has passed, but I still cannot come to terms with how modest and secluded my inauguration has been. Is it worthy of an [Root.GetTitle] to have [Root.GetHerHis] divine right to rule be recognized in the most meager of fashions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAFI117;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] do not care for riches;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAFI117;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] do not care for riches;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAFI117;I deserved way more;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI119;The people of [Root.Capital.GetName] are growing more and more restless every year. A [Root.GetTitle] who has not been inaugurated by the Court will never be seen as legitimate in the eye of any good [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI120;Month after month, I receive news about another one of the Judges of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] accusing me of wickedness during one of his sermons. For as long as I have not been officially inaugurated [Root.GetTitle], the panel will take every opportunity to further undermine my rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAFI120;A generous donation to the Court will shut them up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI121;I can no longer suffer to serve under a wicked [From.GetTitle] who has yet to have [From.GetHerHis] rule be legitimized by the blessing of the Court. It is time that I make my disapproval known beyond doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI127;In a brazen display of disrespect, [From.GetTitledFirstName] proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] would no longer serve as the Attorney General of a wicked [Root.GetTitle] whose rule is still yet to be legitimized by the blessing of the Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAFI127;I must find somebody to inaugurate me soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI122;Though some time has now passed since my inauguration, the good people of [Root.Capital.GetName] are still in a festive mood, glad to finally see their [Root.GetTitle]'s status be recognized by the Court. It would be nice to see my subjects continue to celebrate my rise to the throne, if it were not for the fact that they are also using this as an excuse to work less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAFI122;We could use the festivity to attract more traders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAFI122;Meh, let the rabble have their fun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAFI122;Get back to work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI123;Word of the lavish period of celebration that surrounded my inauguration has spread across the realm and beyond. My name will be forever associated with prestige and wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAFI124;The great celebrations that surrounded my inauguration concluded a while ago, but the trade and wealth they have brought to [Root.Capital.GetName] are still lingering, an unexpected consequence of my generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAAFI125;I am still thinking about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s inauguration. While I was forced by Fate to be crowned alone and in misery, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] flaunted [FromFrom.GetHerHis] munificence with all [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guests and put up a spectacle that will be remembered for years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBAFI125;I am still thinking about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s inauguration.
