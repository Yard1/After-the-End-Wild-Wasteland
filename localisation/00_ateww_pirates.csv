succ_brethren_elective_desc;Pirates practice a unique system of succession, where the most able (and ruthless) capitan takes over. Unlike Feudal Electors, each elector has a different voting strength, based on his prestige, piety and attributes, making some electors more influential than others. The current ruler wields the most influence, unless disfigured, deformed or underage. Direct vassals of the ruler, close family members, Commanders, Councillors and Claimants are all viable candidates for succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
