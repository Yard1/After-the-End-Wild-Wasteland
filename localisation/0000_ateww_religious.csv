# Hamiltonians/Madisonians

hamiltonian;Madisonian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hamiltonian_DESC;Madisonians differ from mainstream Americanism in that they consider the judicary the supreme branch of the government. Legends of Justices of the Supreme Court fighting against tyrannical Presidents and Congressmen have filled them with a conviction that a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is the superior authority on all matters spiritual and temporal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jeffersonian_DESC;Militarism is a splinter Americanist movement that formed as a consequence of the death of President Wyatt Kelleher at the hands of the Deitsch. Finding inspiration in the legends of America's ancient heroes: The United States Military, the Militarists have denounced the Post-Event Presidency as a pathetic farce, and sworn that they shall one day reunite America, by fire and sword if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
