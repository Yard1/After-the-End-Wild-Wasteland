#character
# Triggers when a change of host has been detected. Note that the from scope is empty for newly created characters. "on_employer_change" is triggered first if a character has had both their employer and host changed since the last check was made.
# Root = the character that got a new host
# From = the previous host
# FromFrom = new employer
